My portfolio showcases the intersection of technology, creativity, and advocacy through projects in web development, system projects, and multimedia storytelling. As a Computer Science student and an aspiring journalist, I combine technical expertise with a passion for feminist narratives, cultural identity, and community-driven innovation. From software prototypes and hackathon solutions to short films and publication work, this portfolio reflects my drive to build meaningful digital solutions, amplify local voices, and continuously explore the “Great Perhaps” of learning and purpose.
